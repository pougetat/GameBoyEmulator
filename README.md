# Game boy emulator project

I will use this README to track my progress on my gameboy emulator project. The objectives of this project are the following :
- Learn about emulation by attempting to emulate a simple games system.
- Gain more experience in software design.
	- The code I will be writing will obviously be far from perfect. One idea is to check out existing emulators once I am finished with this project (not before) to try and understand how more experienced developers designed their systems and how I could have gained from their expertise.
- Gain more experience writing C code.
- Have fun.
	- It is very easy to feel paralyzed by the inadequacy of the codebase but I have to keep moving forward and complete my tasks. Otherwise, I will never have a working system. It won't be perfect and that's fine, let's have some fun.

More tasks will be added below as I move through the project and gain a better understanding of the system going from the general flow right down to the last detail.

# Milestone 1 : Scrolling the Nintendo logo (running the boot ROM)

## Work to be done

=> Code cleanup

	TASK : [cpu] move macros into c file and change them into functions
	TASK : [cpu] make registers pointers to integers
	TASK : [Makefile] improvements can be made looking at standard makefiles
	TASK : make header files follow the same format (include order, external APIs prefixed but not internal APIs)

=> Elements necessary to execute the entire boot rom

	TASK : implement LD instructions
	TASK : implement XOR instructions
	TASK : implement BIT instructions
	TASK : implement JR instructions
	TASK : implement INC instructions
	TASK : implement CALL instructions
	TASK : implement CP instructions
	TASK : implement JR instructions
	TASK : implement DEC instructions
	TASK : implement SUB instructions
	TASK : implement PUSH instructions
	TASK : implement RL instructions
	TASK : implement RLA instructions
	TASK : implement POP instructions
	TASK : implement RET instructions
	TASK : implement JR NZ instructions
	TASK : implement ADD instructions

	TASK : [test] verify BG palette setup
	TASK : [test] verify logo data properly loaded
	TASK : [test] verify loading of 8 additional bytes into VRAM
	TASK : [test] verify background tilemap setup
	
=> Elements of logo scrolling

	LCD CONTROL register => 0xFF40
		
			LCDC dictates bg + window display modes (on/off, where they read the data from)
			LCDC dictates sprite mode (on/off, where the sprites are located)
			Etc.
			
			https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/LCDC
			https://nnarain.github.io/2016/09/09/Gameboy-LCD-Controller.html
	
	LCD STAT register => 0xFF41
		
			Indicates current status of the lcd controller module in the cpu (vblank, â€¦) and interrupt selection according to this status (LYC = LY, OAM interrupt, V-blank, H-blank)
	
	TASK : Implement SCY register / SCX register => 0xFF42 / 0xFF43
		
			Indicates the position in the bg map that is to be displayed at the upper (SCY : 0) / left (SCX) LCD display position.
			(values : 0 -> 255)
			
	TASK : Implement LY register => 0xFF44
			
			Indicates the vertical line to which the present data is transferred to the LCD driver (values : 0 -> 153).

	TASK : verify VRAM data

Once I am done I can look at the following emulators (NOT BEFORE) :
